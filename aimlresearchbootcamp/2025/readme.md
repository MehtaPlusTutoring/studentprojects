## Final Projects

### **ML-Driven Insights into the Geosocial Dynamics of Norman Sicily** 

*Team Silly Sicily: Nischith Srikanth, Vivian Tang, Carmen Wang, Selina Zhang*

Abstract: In this 3-part research project, we will analyze elevation patterns, analyze settlement patterns, and
construct a sustainable AI chatbot to facilitate interactive learning of Sicilian history. For the first
part, we used a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques to identify patterns and
correlations between elevation and other characteristics of the sites. Additionally, we employed
unsupervised machine learning methods such as k-means clustering, which allows spatial visualization
of these historical sites that can reveal geographic groupings and potential settlement trends. Moreover,
to help users track and find information more efficiently, we designed and developed a chatbot powered
by large language models (LLM), specifically GPT-4o from OpenAI. To ensure factual accuracy
and minimize hallucination and inferences from the chatbot, we integrated Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), allowing the chatbot to retrieve relevant information directly from a curated
dataset. The resulting system offers a user-friendly interface hosted on Streamlit. Ultimately, this
research bridges the disciplines of history and data science, offering an effective and interactive
solution to historical researchers and educators interested in both geographic and cultural insights.

### **Lost Leaves: ML Classification of Early Modern and Medieval Libraries** 

*Team Unbeleafable: Abubakr Usman, Cindy Liu, Kritik Jain*

Abstract: The ability to access and process what is left of historical academia is invaluable to the study of bygone societies. However, manually reading through large volumes of historical catalogs written in multiple languages requires not only language proficiency, but an impractical amount of dedication and time. In this paper, we propose an ML-based approach to extract structured genre-specific data from such catalogs. This approach extracts names of libraries, the works they hold, and the likely primary literature category in their collections based on pre-processed text. Using BERT and GPT-4o, our model scores an overall accuracy of 87% for identifying genres of books mentioned in texts. This model can replace manual record-keeping with an automated version.

### **Movie Dialogue Clustering for Character Comparison** 

*Team Cookie Fans: Gary Shen, Paul Yoo, Abdullah Arshad, Muhammad Ahmed Imran*

Abstract: Character dialogues in movies convey narrative roles and emotional depth, yet existing analyses often rely on single-feature approaches, such as sentiment or topic modeling, which fail to capture the multifaceted nature of dialogue styles across genres. This study addresses this limitation by applying k-means clustering to group 103 characters from 34 films in a custom dataset, movie_dialogues.csv, to uncover stylistic and thematic patterns for applications in scriptwriting, film studies, and recommendation systems. We selected KMeans for its scalability and ability to handle high-dimensional dialogue features, comparing three feature sets: stylistic (19 features), semantic (384-dimensional embeddings), and hybrid (∼50 features). Experiment 1’s 9-cluster configuration achieves balanced cohesion (44.44% accuracy, 33.33% diversity), grouping characters by stylistic traits like verbosity, while Experiment 2’s semantic embeddings yield the highest net accuracy (35%) by capturing thematic roles (e.g., heroic vs. sarcastic dialogues). Qualitatively, clusters reveal archetypes like sci-fi
protagonists or comedic sidekicks, enhancing narrative analysis. These results establish a robust
framework for dialogue clustering, though hybrid features risk overfitting. Future work aims to refine feature selection and apply findings to automated script analysis tools.

## Mid Projects
This year, for their midterm project, students worked with PhD student, Ms. Holly Brown from University of Birmingham on a research project.

Students were presented with three works by 15th century Iberian women writers written in Castilian Spanish and Catalan. They were tasked to identify rhetorical devices and annotate the texts. Many students used natural language processing models like BERT and large language models (LLMs) such as Gemini to create an annotation pipeline.
