Each summer, MehtA+ offers a 6-week AI/Machine Learning Research Bootcamp where students learn the theory and application of AI and machine learning and then apply these techniques to a digital humanities or science project with a real world impact. Here are 10 examples of super cool projects that students have worked on. 

1) Improving the state-of-the-art ancient Greek lemmatizer
2) Dating an Italian philosopher's texts using handwriting recognition
3) Training an AI to mimick the chess skills of an amateur chess player
4) Classifying whether a patient has melanoma using images of skin lesions
5) Charting the evolution of the word "que" in the Spanish language 
6) Analyzing sentiment of tweets for stock price prediction. 
7) Identifying Fake News
8) Determining the author of disputed Federalist papers
9) Predicted weather-related flight delays
10) Grouping an art museum's works thematically 


We graciously thank the following universities who have been our partners for this program. While MehtA+ instructors focused on mentoring students in the AI/machine learning aspects of the projects during the bootcamp, professors from these universities volunteered their time and provided datasets and domain knowledge as students worked on active areas of research. Many of our students have also gone on to research in these professors' labs after the bootcamp and are working on getting published!

1) Haverford College
2) Kenyon College
3) Singapore Institute of Technology, Singapore
4) Northeastern University
5) University of Bologna, Italy
6) University of Buffalo SUNY
7) University of Groningen, Netherlands
8) Williams College
9) Williams & Mary College
