This github repo showcases the projects of MehtA+ students from our various camps. Please note that projects from all camps may not be featured since some of the students' projects are in collaboration with startups and or with universities in active areas of research and cannot be published online. 

For more information on all our camps, please check our [website](https://mehtaplustutoring.com/).

## Student Projects 

Please navigate to the camp that you are interested in and look through the various years for past projects. 

[AI/Machine Learning Research Bootcamp](aimlresearchbootcamp) - 6-week bootcamp offered in the summers where students learn the theory and application of AI and machine learning and then apply these techniques to a digital humanities or science project with a real world impact
