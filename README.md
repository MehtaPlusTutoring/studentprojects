This github repo showcases the projects of MehtA+ students from our various camps. Please note that projects from all camps may not be featured since some of the students' projects are in collaboration with startups and or with universities in active areas of research and cannot be published online. 

For more information on all our camps, please check our [website](https://mehtaplustutoring.com/).
